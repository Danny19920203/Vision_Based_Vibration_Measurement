## Description
We are collecting both traditional accelerometer data (for absolute acceleration measurements), as well as optical, non-contact measurements to capture the displacements (see Figure 5). These two physical measurements will provide different types of evidence of the structureâ€™s response to the ground motion. 


## Source Code & Data
* All source code and data are released in this repository. 
* You can feel free to use the codes and data for your research !!

## How to run
* Once you download the source code and images in your directory, you can simply run `RunDemo` and the video will be created in the result folder.
